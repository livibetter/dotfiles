# COMPLETION_TYPE: 'complete', 'menu-complete' or 'quiet-complete'.
#
# 'complete'       : as usual (see bash(1))
# 'menu-complete'  : makes <TAB> cycle through completions on the

#                    completions (see bash(1)).
# 'quiet-complete' : like 'complete' with the following readline settings:
#                      - page-completions off
#	               - print-completions-horizontally on
#	               - completion-query-items -1
#
#                    This means although completions are shown you will not
#                    get to see them in a one-line terminal.

# Additional bash setup
#
# Since this file will be used as the rcfile for the bash session
# invoked by bashrun, you can do anything here that you would usually
# do in your ~/.bashrc. For example, you might set environment
# variables, define functions or aliases, bind additional function
# keys, etc.
#
# Just make sure that you don't interfere with the tty/bash settings
# and keybindings used by bashrun (see the manual page). If you need
# to know exactely what is going on, take a look at
# $PREFIX/share/bashrun/bashrc
