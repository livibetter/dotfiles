# Grab weather data from weather.com and format it according to the given XSLT

# Modified by Hellf[i]re
# The orignal script and xslt can be downloaded from http://pondol.com/weather.tar.gz

# Usage:
# ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh location}
# Usage Example:
# ${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh 03833}

# your Location ID: use http://xoap.weather.com/search/search?where=[yourcity] to find it 
# U.S. users can just use their zip code; doubt that works for anyone else though (YMMV)

# you probably don't need to modify anything below this point....
